	abstract = {High-dimensional optimization is a critical challenge for operating large-scale scientific facilities. We apply a physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) optimizer to tune a complex system. Typical GP models learn from past observations to make predictions, but this reduces their applicability to systems where there is limited relevant archive data. Instead, here we use a fast approximate model from physics simulations to design the GP model. The GP is then employed to make inferences from sequential online observations in order to optimize the system. Simulation and experimental studies were carried out to demonstrate the method for online control of a storage ring. Our method is a simple prescription to construct a custom GP model, including correlations between the high-dimensional input space, while encoding the physical response of a system. The ability to inform the machine-learning model with physics, without relying on the availability and range of prior data, may have wide applications in science.},

	abstract = {Particle accelerators are invaluable discovery engines in the chemical, biological and physical sciences. Characterization of the accelerated beam response to accelerator input parameters is often the first step when conducting accelerator-based experiments. Currently used techniques for characterization, such as grid-like parameter sampling scans, become impractical when extended to higher dimensional input spaces, when complicated measurement constraints are present, or prior information known about the beam response is scarce. Here in this work, we describe an adaptation of the popular Bayesian optimization algorithm, which enables a turn-key exploration of input parameter spaces. Our algorithm replaces  the need for parameter scans while minimizing prior information needed about the measurement’s behavior and associated measurement constraints. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm autonomously conducts an adaptive, multi-parameter exploration of input parameter space, potentially orders of magnitude faster than conventional grid-like parameter scans, while making highly constrained, single-shot beam phase-space measurements and accounts for costs associated with changing input parameters. In addition to applications in accelerator-based scientific experiments, this algorithm addresses challenges shared by many scientific disciplines, and is thus applicable to autonomously conducting experiments over a broad range of research topics.},

	abstract = {Particle accelerators require constant tuning during operation to meet beam quality, total charge and particle energy requirements for use in a wide variety of physics, chemistry and biology experiments. Maximizing the performance of an accelerator facility often necessitates multiobjective optimization, where operators must balance trade-offs between multiple competing objectives simultaneously, often using limited, temporally expensive beam observations. Usually, accelerator optimization problems are solved off-line, prior to actual operation, with advanced beam line simulations and parallelized optimization methods (NSGA-II, swarm optimization). Unfortunately, it is not feasible to use these methods for online multiobjective optimization, since beam measurements can only be done in a serial fashion, and these optimization methods require a large number of measurements to converge to a useful solution. Here, we introduce a multiobjective Bayesian optimization scheme, which finds the full Pareto front of an accelerator optimization problem efficiently in a serialized manner and is thus a critical step towards practical online multiobjective optimization in accelerators. This method uses a set of Gaussian process surrogate models, along with a multiobjective acquisition function, to reduce the number of observations needed to converge by at least an order of magnitude over current methods. We demonstrate how this method can be modified to specifically solve optimization challenges posed by the tuning of accelerators. This includes the addition of optimization constraints, objective preferences and costs related to changing accelerator parameters.},

Hysteresis effects in magnetic, mechanical, and material components of accelerators are often neglected in online accelerator models used to inform control algorithms, even though reproducibility errors from systems exhibiting hysteresis are not negligible in high precision accelerators. In this Letter, we combine the classical Preisach model of hysteresis with machine learning techniques to efficiently create nonparametric, high-fidelity models of arbitrary systems exhibiting hysteresis. We experimentally demonstrate how these methods can be used in situ, where a hysteresis model of an accelerator magnet is combined with a Bayesian statistical model of the beam response, allowing characterization of magnetic hysteresis solely from beam-based measurements. Finally, we explore how using these joint hysteresis-Bayesian statistical models allows us to overcome optimization performance limitations that arise when hysteresis effects are ignored.},

	abstract = {Bayesian Optimization is a sample-efficient black-box optimization procedure that is typically applied to problems with a small number of independent objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined over many correlated outcomes (or ``tasks"). For example, scientists may want to optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of locations. Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot across dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization. However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic surrogates for multi-task Bayesian Optimization scale poorly with the number of outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in the covariance matrices with Matheron's identity, allowing us to perform Bayesian Optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that only model aggregate functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of applications for Bayesian Optimization across a range of tasks in science and engineering, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical interferometer with more than 65,000 outputs.},

The coherence of the correction algorithm is ensured through specifying a self-consistent regularization coefficient to prevent overfitting. Optimal weights for different correction objectives are obtained based on their measurement noise level. A new technique has been developed to resolve degenerated quadrupole errors when observed at a few select beam position monitors (BPMs).

We introduce an approach based on machine learning to create nonlinear, fast-executing surrogate models that are informed by a sparse sampling of the physics simulation. The models are O(106)–O(107) times more computationally efficient to execute. We also demonstrate that these models can be reliably used with multiobjective optimization to obtain orders-of-magnitude speedup in initial design studies and experiment planning. For example, we required 132 times fewer simulation evaluations to obtain an equivalent solution for our main test case, and initial studies suggest that between 330–550 times fewer simulation evaluations are needed when using an iterative retraining process. Our approach enables new ways for high-fidelity particle accelerator simulations to be used, at comparatively little computational cost.},

These can be difficult to attain through manual tuning by human operators without potentially leaving the system in a suboptimal and irreproducible state. In this work, we present the first development of online Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian process model to tune an ion beam through a nuclear astrophysics recoil separator. We show that this method achieves small incoming angular deviations ({\textless}1 mrad) in an efficient and reproducible manner that is at least 3 times faster than standard hand-tuning. Additionally, we present a Bayesian method for experimental optimization of the ion optics, and show that it validates the nominal theoretical ion-optical settings of the device, and improves the mass separation by 32\% for some beams.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03229},
	abstract = {Bayesian optimization is known to be difficult to scale to high dimensions, because the acquisition step requires solving a non-convex optimization problem in the same search space. In order to scale the method and keep its benefits, we propose an algorithm (LineBO) that restricts the problem to a sequence of iteratively chosen one-dimensional sub-problems that can be solved efficiently. We show that our algorithm converges globally and obtains a fast local rate when the function is strongly convex. Further, if the objective has an invariant subspace, our method automatically adapts to the effective dimension without changing the algorithm. When combined with the SafeOpt algorithm to solve the sub-problems, we obtain the first safe Bayesian optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees applicable in high-dimensional settings. We evaluate our method on multiple synthetic benchmarks, where we obtain competitive performance. Further, we deploy our algorithm to optimize the beam intensity of the Swiss Free Electron Laser with up to 40 parameters while satisfying safe operation constraints.},

	abstract = {Big Data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.},

It is also the first electron cooler applied directly to colliding hadron beams. The unique approach to cooling makes beam dynamics in LEReC very different from the conventional electron coolers. Numerous LEReC parameters can affect the cooling rate. One of the most critical factors is the alignment of the electron and ion trajectories in the cooling section. In this work, we apply Bayesian optimization to check and if needed to optimize the trajectories’ alignment. Experimental results are presented and it is demonstrated that machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to perform the control tasks effectively in the RHIC controls system.},

	abstract = {Beam parameter optimization in accelerators involves multiple, sometimes competing, objectives. Condensing these individual objectives into a single figure of merit unavoidably results in a bias towards particular outcomes, often in an undesired way in the absence of prior knowledge. Finding an optimal objective definition then requires operators to iterate over many possible objective weights and definitions, a process that can take many times longer than the optimization itself. A more versatile approach is multi-objective optimization, which establishes the trade-off curve or Pareto front between objectives. Here we present the first results on multi-objective Bayesian optimization of a simulated laser-plasma accelerator. We find that multi-objective optimization reaches comparable performance to its single-objective counterparts while allowing for instant evaluation of entirely new objectives. This dramatically reduces the time required to find appropriate objective definitions for new problems. Additionally, our multi-objective, multi-fidelity method reduces the time required for an optimization run by an order of magnitude. It does so by dynamically choosing simulation resolution and box size, requiring fewer slow and expensive simulations as it learns about the Pareto-optimal solutions from fast low-resolution runs. The techniques demonstrated in this paper can easily be translated into many different computational and experimental use cases beyond accelerator optimization.},

The algorithm was also successfully used to ease the commissioning phase after the installation of new injection magnets and is regularly used during accelerator operations. We demonstrate that the introduction of context variables that include intrabunch scattering effects, such as the Touschek effect, further improves the control and robustness of the injection process.},

Here, we use Bayesian optimization of key laser and plasma parameters to flatten the longitudinal phase space of an ionization-injected electron bunch via optimal beam loading. We first study the concept with particle-in-cell simulations and then demonstrate it in experiments. Starting from an arbitrary set point, the plasma accelerator autonomously tunes the beam energy spread to the subpercent level at 254 MeV and 4.7 pC/MeV spectral density. Finally, we study a robust regime, which improves the stability of the laser-plasma accelerator and delivers sub-five-percent rms energy spread beams for 90\% of all shots.},

While many off-the-shelf optimization algorithms are available, in practice their use is limited because most methods do not account for safety-critical constraints in each iteration, such as loss signals or step-size limitations. One notable exception is safe Bayesian optimization, which is a data-driven tuning approach for global optimization with noisy feedback. We propose and evaluate a step-size limited variant of safe Bayesian optimization on two research facilities of the PSI: (a) the SwissFEL and (b) HIPA. We report promising experimental results on both machines, tuning up to 16 parameters subject to 224 constraints.},

An important next step toward FRIB user operation includes fast tuning of the Front End (FE) decision parameters to maintain optimal beam optics. The FE consists of the ion source, charge selection system, LEBT, RFQ, and MEBT. The strong coupling of many ion source parameters, strong space-charge effects in multi-component ion beams, and a not well-known neutralization factor in the beamline from the ion source to the charge selection system make the FE modeling difficult.
